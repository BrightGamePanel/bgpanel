					INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
===================================================================

1. Unzip the contents of the .zip file to a folder on your computer.

3. Upload the entire contents of the folder '/upload_me' to your website in binary mode. It is recommended to change the name of the '/admin' folder.

4. CHMOD file '/.ssh/passphrase' to 0777.

5. Run the installation script at http://www.yourdomain.com/install/index.php

6. Once complete, delete the install folder from your web server.

7. CHMOD file '/.ssh/passphrase' to 0644.

8. Do not forget to schedule the cron job.

Enjoy BrightGamePanel !
